**_Members of OSRG Organization will not need to Fork the Dungeon_**

## At the start of every Raid the **Target** must be [forked](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)!!

- Find the Forked Raid Repo (Current Dungeon) in [OSRG Organization](https://github.com/OpenSourceRaidGuild)
- Create a fork of the repository that is saved to your Profile
- `git clone` this version of the repo to your local dev environment.
- [Configure the remote upstream for your fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
