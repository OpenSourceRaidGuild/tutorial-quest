# Hi :wave: Welcome to the OSS Raid Group :crossed_swords:

### `Find Target` :dart: `Communicate` :satellite: `Raid` :crossed_swords: `Push Code` :tada:

The OSS Raid Group is what happens when you combine MMORPGs, Programming, and Open Source Software - a group dedicated to defeating the Raid Bosses of OSS!

For those who aren't aware of these 'gamer' terms, and even those that are; here are the definitions we use when operating as a Raid Group.

| Phrase    | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Raid | A Raid is the OSS project's issue that we are working to resolve - see how we [converted react-hooks-testing-library to TypeScript](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library/pull/520) for an example |
| Raid Boss | The Raid Boss is the issue that we are 'fighting' to resolve |
| Raid Group | The collective noun for all contributors to the Raid |
| Raid Repo | The repository for the current Raid that has been forked into the kcdraidgroup Org |

## Storyline Quest (mission) :scroll:

Objectives:

* To make contributing to OSS enjoyable, engaging, and with a low barrier-to-entry for those who have never done it before
* To have a high impact in a small amount of time; specifically targetting low-medium contributor activity, medium-high usage of the project, with only a handful of maintainers

What it's about:

* It's about winning the Raid as a group, not about who made the biggest contribution(s)
* It's about learning together; teaching each other
* It's about having fun and getting into something you may not have done on your own

<!-- Previous points
- Themed from MMORPG gaming, gamifiying Mob programming OSS repos
- Look for criteria in OSS repos 
  1. Low to medium contributor activity, only a handful of maintainers
  2. Medium to high usage of the OSS 
  3. Our impact can be potentially high; in a few days

## Join Us! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

Anyone is welcome to participate in our Raids - no matter your experience level! Never contributed to an OSS project? No worries! We are all learning something or another, so come along for the ride!

### Intake Quests

1. Say hello to your fellow raiders in the #:bee:-raid-general channel on [Discord][discord]
2. Raise your first issue against a raid, and start contributing!

### Advancements

When you are:
* Actively contributing to Raids
* Being an active community member on the KCD Discord Server

Then we can determine responsibilities and get you running as either an Org member or Collab (reduced permissions)

## Raids :crossed_swords:

* One Raid at a time to maximize impact in a short amount of time.

### Communication

We primarily communicate via [Discord][discord] in the `OSS-RAID-GROUP` category

### Workflow

When participating in a Raid, use the following steps.

1. Raise an issue in the Raid repo with a one-liner title describing what you are working on - for example `Migrate page-header/breadcrumbs tests to testing-library`
2. Fork the Raid Repo
3. Create a branch named after your GitHub username - e.g. `nobrayner`
4. Hack away :sunglasses::computer:
5. Create a PR titled the same as your issue, and a desciption of `Fixes #{ISSUE_NO}` - [like this PR for example](https://github.com/kcdraidgroup/hospitalrun-frontend/pull/8)
