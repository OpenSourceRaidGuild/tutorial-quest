# Hi :wave: Welcome to the OSS Raid Group :crossed_swords:

The OSS Raid Group is what happens when you combine MMORPGs, Programming, and Open Source Software - a group dedicated to defeating the Raid Bosses of OSS

For those who aren't aware of these 'gamer' terms, and even those that are; here are the definitions we use when operating as a Raid Group.

| Phrase    | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
| Raid | A Raid is the OSS project's issue that we are working to resolve - see how we [converted react-hooks-testing-library to TypeScript](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library/pull/520) for an example |
| Raid Boss | The Raid Boss is the issue that we are 'fighting' to resolve |
| Raid Group | The collective noun for all contributors to the Raid |

## Storyline Quest (mission) :scroll:

- Themed from MMORPG gaming, gamifiying Mob programming OSS repos
- Look for criteria in OSS repos 
  1. Low to medium contributor activity, only a handful of maintainers
  2. Medium to high usage of the OSS 
  3. Our impact can be potentially high; in a few days

## Join Us! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

Anoyone is welcome to participate in the raids; just raise an issue in the current raid repo, and [...TBD]

### Intake Quests

1. Say hello to your fellow raiders in the #🐝-raid-general channel on [Discord][discord]
2. Raise your first issue against a raid, and start contributing!

### Advancements

When you are:
* Actively contributing to Raids
* Being an active community member on the [KCD Discord][discord]

Then we can determine responsibilities and get you running as either an Org member or Collab (reduced permissions)

## The Process :fire:
### `Find Target` :dart: `Communicate` :satellite: `Raid` :crossed_swords: `Push Code` :tada:

One Raid at a time to maximize impact in short amount of time.

## Communication :smiley:
