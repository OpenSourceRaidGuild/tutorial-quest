# Hi :wave: Welcome to the Open Source Raid Guild :crossed_swords:

### `Find Target` :dart: `Communicate` :satellite: `Raid` :crossed_swords: `Push Code` :tada:

The OSS Raid Group is what happens when you combine MMORPGs (Gamification), Mob Programming, Crowdsourcing, and Open Source Software - a group dedicated to defeating the Raid Bosses of OSS!

For those who aren't aware of these 'gamer' terms, and even those that are; here are the definitions we use when operating as a Raid Guild.

| Phrase                        | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Raid                          | A Raid is the OSS project's issue that we are working to resolve - see how we [converted react-hooks-testing-library to TypeScript](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library/pull/520) for an example |
| Raid Boss                     | The Raid Boss is the large issue/problem domain that we are 'fighting' to resolve                                                                                                                                           |
| Open Source Raid Guild (OSRG) | The collective noun for all contributors to the Raid                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Raid Repo                     | The repository for the current Raid that has been forked into the OpenSourceRaidGuild Org                                                                                                                                   |
| Dungeon                       | The working fork repository that the Raid is operating inside of; multiple Raids can occur in one Dungeon but only one Raid at a time                                                                                       |

## Storyline Quest (mission) :scroll:

Objectives:

- To make contributing to OSS enjoyable, engaging, and with a low barrier-to-entry for those who have never done it before
- To have a high impact in a small amount of time; specifically targetting low-medium contributor activity, medium-high usage of the project, with only a handful of maintainers

What it's about:

- It's about winning the Raid as a group, not about who made the biggest contribution(s).
- It's about learning together; teaching each other, flattening the learning curve.
- It's about having fun and getting into something you may not have done on your own.
- Its's about lowering or even removing the bar of entry for OSS contributing for everyone.
- Most of all it is about having FUN!

<!-- Previous points
- Themed from MMORPG gaming, gamifiying Mob programming OSS repositories
- Look for criteria in OSS repositories
  1. Low to medium contributor activity, only a handful of maintainers
  2. Medium to high usage of the OSS
  3. Our impact can be potentially high; in a few days
-->

## Join Us! :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:

Anyone is welcome to participate in our Raids - no matter your experience level! Never contributed to an OSS project? No worries! We are all learning something or another, so come along for the ride!

### Intake Quests

1. Say hello to your fellow Guild Members in [Discord][discord]
2. [Jump into a Raid, and start contributing!](https://github.com/OpenSourceRaidGuild/tutorial-quest#workflow)

### Advancements

When you are:

- Actively contributing to Raids
- Being an active community member on the OSRG Discord Server

Then we can determine responsibilities and get you running as either an outside collaborator on new Raids, eventually becoming a member on the Raid Org

## Raids :crossed_swords:

- One Raid at a time to maximize impact in a short amount of time.

### Communication :satellite:

- We primarily communicate via [Discord][discord]
- Guild Roles are assigned to individuals based on time, activity in Raids and contributions to OSRG as a whole, everyone starts off as an Guild Initiate who joins.

### Workflow

When participating in a Raid, use the following steps.

1. Raise an issue in the Raid repo with a one-liner title describing what you are working on - for example `Migrate page-header/breadcrumbs tests to testing-library`
2. Fork the Raid Repo ([Raid Git Workflow](./git.md))
3. Create a branch named after your GitHub username - e.g. `nobrayner`
4. Hack away :sunglasses::computer:
5. Create a PR titled the same as your issue, and a description of `Fixes #{ISSUE_NO}` - [like this PR for example](https://github.com/OpenSourceRaidGuild/hospitalrun-frontend/pull/8)
